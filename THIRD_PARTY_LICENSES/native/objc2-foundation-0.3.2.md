/// A helper type for implementing [`NSCopying`].
///
/// `NSCopying` and `NSMutableCopying` do not in their signatures describe the
/// result type from the copying operation. This is problematic, as it means
/// that using them ends up falling back to [`AnyObject`], which makes copying
/// much less useful and ergonomic.
///
/// To properly describe this, we need an associated type which describes the
/// actual result type from a copy. The associated type can't be present
/// directly on the protocol traits themselves, however, since we want to use
/// them as e.g. `ProtocolObject<dyn NSCopying>`, so we introduce this helper
/// trait instead. See [`MutableCopyingHelper`] for the mutable variant.
///
/// We might be able to get rid of this hack once [associated type defaults]
/// are stabilized.

/// [associated type defaults]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29661

# License

The licensing of these crates is a bit complicated:
- The crates `objc2`, `block2`, `objc2-foundation` and `objc2-encode` are
  [currently][#23] licensed under [the MIT license][MIT].
- All other crates are trio-licensed under the [Zlib], [Apache-2.0] or [MIT]
  license, at your option.

Furthermore, the crates are (usually automatically) derived from Apple SDKs,
and that may have implications for licensing, see below for details.

[#23]: https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/23
[MIT]: https://opensource.org/license/MIT
[Zlib]: https://zlib.net/zlib_license.html
[Apache-2.0]: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0


## Apple SDKs

These crates are derived from Apple SDKs shipped with Xcode. You can obtain a
copy of the Xcode license at:

https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/xcode.pdf

Or by typing `xcodebuild -license` in your terminal.

From reading the license, it is unclear whether distributing derived works
such as these crates are allowed?

But in any case, to practically use these crates, you will have to link, and
that only works when you have the correct Xcode SDK available to provide the
required `.tbd` files, which is why we choose to still use the normal SPDX
identifiers in the crates (Xcode is required to use the crates, and when using
Xcode you have already agreed to the Xcode license).
